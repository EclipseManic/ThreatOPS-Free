# ThreatOPS-Free
ThreatOps Free is a comprehensive, open-source Security Operations Center (SOC) simulator that demonstrates real-world threat hunting, detection, and response capabilities. Built entirely with free and open-source technologies, this project serves as both an educational tool and a practical demonstration of modern SOC workflows.
